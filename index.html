            <p>Welcome, Planeswalker! ðŸŽ´<br>If you're new to Magic: The Gathering, this guide will help you understand the basics of building a fun and effective deck.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="format">
            <h2>1. Choose Your Format</h2>
            <p>Magic: The Gathering offers a variety of formats, broadly categorized as Constructed and Limited. Constructed formats like Standard, Modern, Legacy, and Vintage involve pre-built decks following specific rules about card legality. We recommend starting with <strong>Commander</strong>â€”a casual, fun, multiplayer format that emphasizes creativity.</p>

            <h3>Constructed Formats</h3>
            <p>In Constructed formats, players build decks from their personal collection of Magic cards, following the specific legal card restrictions of the format.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Standard</strong>: Uses the most recent card sets, typically from the last 2 years of releases.</li>
                <li><strong>Modern</strong>: Allows cards from more recent sets, starting from 8th Edition and Mirrodin onward.</li>
                <li><strong>Legacy</strong>: A larger pool of cards, including almost all Magic cards ever printed (with a few banned).</li>
                <li><strong>Vintage</strong>: The most expansive format, allowing nearly every card ever printed, but with a very limited number of copies for certain powerful cards.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Limited Formats</h3>
            <p>Limited formats involve constructing a deck from a limited pool of cards, usually obtained from booster packs. This tests players' skills in card evaluation and deck building on the fly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sealed</strong>: Players open six booster packs and construct a deck from only those cards.</li>
                <li><strong>Draft</strong>: Players take turns selecting cards from booster packs to build a deck, creating a unique challenge each time.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Pick a Commander or Theme</h2>
            <p>Build your deck around a legendary creature or a mechanic like "lifegain" or "tokens".</p>

            <h2>3. Balance Your Cards</h2>
            <p>In Magic: The Gathering, a good rule of thumb for balancing your cards is to aim for a balanced color distribution, a well-defined mana curve, and a strategy-appropriate mix of card types. This involves having a relatively equal number of cards in each color, ensuring your mana curve is smooth, and your deck's card types (creatures, instants, sorceries, etc.) support your overall strategy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>35â€“38 Lands</li>
                <li>10 Ramp Spells</li>
                <li>10â€“12 Card Draw Spells</li>
                <li>5â€“10 Removal Spells</li>
                <li>Lots of fun win conditions!</li>
            </ul>
