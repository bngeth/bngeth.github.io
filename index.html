    <main>
        <p>Welcome Planeswalker! ðŸŽ´<br>
        If you're new to Magic: The Gathering, this guide will help you understand the basics of building a fun and effective deck.</p>

        <h2>1. Choose Your Format</h2>
        <p>Magic: The Gathering offers a variety of formats, broadly categorized as Constructed and Limited. Constructed formats like Standard, Modern, Legacy, and Vintage involve pre-built decks following specific rules about card legality. We recommend starting with <strong>Commander</strong>â€”a casual, fun, multiplayer format that emphasizes creativity.</p>

        <h3>Constructed Formats</h3>
        <p>In Constructed formats, players build decks from their personal collection of Magic cards, following the specific legal card restrictions of the format.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Standard</strong>: Uses the most recent card sets, typically from the last 2 years of releases.</li>
            <li><strong>Modern</strong>: Allows cards from more recent sets, starting from 8th Edition and Mirrodin onward.</li>
            <li><strong>Legacy</strong>: A larger pool of cards, including almost all Magic cards ever printed (with a few banned).</li>
            <li><strong>Vintage</strong>: The most expansive format, allowing nearly every card ever printed, but with a very limited number of copies for certain powerful cards.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limited Formats</h3>
        <p>Limited formats involve constructing a deck from a limited pool of cards, usually obtained from booster packs. This tests players' skills in card evaluation and deck building on the fly.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sealed</strong>: Players open six booster packs and construct a deck from only those cards.</li>
            <li><strong>Draft</strong>: Players take turns selecting cards from booster packs to build a deck, creating a unique challenge each time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Pick a Commander or Theme</h2>
        <p>Build your deck around a legendary creature or a mechanic like "lifegain" or "tokens".</p>

        <h2>3. Balance Your Cards</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>35â€“38 Lands</li>
            <li>10 Ramp Spells</li>
            <li>10â€“12 Card Draw Spells</li>
            <li>5â€“10 Removal Spells</li>
            <li>Lots of fun win conditions!</li>
        </ul>
